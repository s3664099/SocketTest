# SocketTest
 Initial Program to Test Sockets

This program was written with the assistance of my Dad to enable me to understand the way sockets are used in programming.
There are two sections to this program, one that sets up a server and waits for a socket to connect, and a second that will 
connect to a server socket, send a message, and then wait for a response.
